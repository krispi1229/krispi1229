### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate and driven Computer Science student at the University of Melbourne. My interest in problem-solving and fascination with technology led me to pursue a career in software development. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a robust web application using the MEAN (MongoDB, Express.js, Angular, and Node.js) stack, focusing on creating a scalable architecture and efficient code.


ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m presently delving deeper into the field of Computer science and Artificial Intelligence, and I am always eager to learn about new technologies and methodologies in data science.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to Software develp, Machine Learning and AI. I'm open to other projects as well, as I love learning new technologies and languages.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Java, Python, C, Data Structures, Algorithms, Machine Learning, and AI.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can email me at pikp@student.unimelb.edu.au or connect with me on linkedin.com/in/kangpi1229.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you'll find me play soccer, reading a book, playing the piano, or exploring the outdoors!

Always open to new opportunities and challenges!
