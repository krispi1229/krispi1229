### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a passionate and driven Computer Science student at the University of Melbourne. My interest in problem-solving and fascination with technology led me to pursue a career in software development. 

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my capstone project which involves the application of Machine Learning algorithms for pattern recognition.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m presently delving deeper into the field of Data Science and Artificial Intelligence, and I am always eager to learn about new technologies and methodologies in software development.

ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open-source projects related to Machine Learning and AI. I'm open to other projects as well, as I love learning new technologies and languages.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me about Python, Java, C++, Data Structures, Algorithms, Machine Learning, and AI.

ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can email me at [your-email]@student.unimelb.edu.au or connect with me on [LinkedIn](Your LinkedIn Profile Link).

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: He/Him

âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you'll find me reading a book, playing the piano, or exploring the outdoors!

Always open to new opportunities and challenges!
